# Authentication
- Write ups to include lessons learned and some answers for what the THM labs involve

## Enumeration & Brute Force - Write Up

### Enumerating Users via Verbose Errors
- Testing out poor auth (e.g. using a python script to test out logging in until you recieve an `Invalid password` error instead of `Email does not exist`)
- Tested out a python script to enumberate a list of usernames / gmail email addresses

### Exploiting Vulnerable Password Reset Logic
- Used Burp suite intruder functionality to replicate the use of a randomized token to force getting a valid tokenf or a password reset and getting the password


### Basic Auth 
- Used Burp suite to proxy a web browser session and capture the login attempt, decode the base64-encded value
- Used a password list to then run through login attempts via intruder to get a 200 status code respose. From there, taking that password we can login successfully

#### Using Hyra
- Using the hydra tool, we were able to replicate the same functionality as in Burp using the command line

```bash
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/500-worst-passwords.txt http-get://enum.thm/labs/basic_auth/
```

### OSINT
- Exmaple of using the way back machine and a tool [waybackurls](https://github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls) to see old fiels such as secerts, etc. that may be available

## Session Magement - Write Up
