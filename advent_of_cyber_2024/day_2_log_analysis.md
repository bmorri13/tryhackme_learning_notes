## Log Analysis

- Goes over log searching basics with Elastic. How to look for events, time ranges, how to use filters for an investigation, etc.
- TLDR Splunk is still better than Elastic

### Room Example
- Went through analysis for the log events to find the authentication events and reviewing the timing for auth sucess and faulures along with reviewing what actions were taken from the powershell commands.
