## Wi-Fi WPA/WPA 2 Cracking 

- Reviewed various wifi attacks
    - Evil Twin
    - Route access point
    - WPS attack
    - WPA / WPA2 cracking

### Room Example
- Tested using airodump-ng and aireplay-ng. The wireless interface was switched to monitor mode to capture the WPA handshake. This handshake was then used in an offline brute-force or dictionary attack to recover the password and authenticate to the wireless network.
