# Advent of Cyber 2024

## Azure

- Went over using azure, sample commands for azurecli to get out information, nothing much more really from this one

### Room Example

- Tested out using azurecli to get out user information and getting a list of users where the password was stored in a key pair example
- Using that information and group assignment, we were able to login as that user, add ourselves a part of the Secret Assignmnet group and then read out an Azure Key Vaule secret to retrieve the daily flag.
