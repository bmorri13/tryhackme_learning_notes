## Intro to GRC

- This is cancer...but necessary daily
- Reviewed what GRC is
- Reviewed what a Risk Assesment is 
    - Reviewing what a system, 3rd party system, Saas app, etc. has in regards to compliance coverage, things such as SAML, encryption, etc.
- Assessment Items:
    - Likelihood to Each Risk 
        - Quantify risk, we need to identify how likely or probable it is that the risk will materialise
            1. Improbable: So unlikely that it might never happen.
            2. Remote: Very unlikely to happen, but still, there is a possibility.
            3. Occasional: Likely to happen once/sometime.
            4. Probable: Likely to happen several times.
            5. Frequent: Likely to happen often and regularly.
    - Impact to Each Risk
        - Quantify the impact this risk's materialisation might have on the organisation (e.g. what happens if we let this go unpatched, managed, etc.)
            1. Informational: Very low impact, almost non-existent.
            2. Low: Impacting a limited part of one area of the organisation's operations, with little to no revenue loss.
            3. Medium: Impacting one part of the organisation's operations completely, with major revenue loss.
            4. High: Impacting several parts of the organisation's operations, causing significant revenue loss
            5. Critical: Posing an existential threat to the organisation.
> NOTE: Everything here is subjective and is based upon your experience and needs and you must be able to defend it as it gets reviwed.

### Room Example
- Ran through risk assessment scenarios
- Since this is so subjective, I am not sure this is accurate and I could explain multiple of these items for having a higher impact.
