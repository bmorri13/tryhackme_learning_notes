# Advent of Cyber 2024

## Malware Sandbox

- Tested out YARA rules and seeing how malware is detected
- Tested out how we can create mawlare that will evade YARA rules by doing thigns such as base64 encoding command strings within the file so that it cannot be detected wiht simple YARA rules
- Used Floss to test out scanning a file

### Room Example
- Tested out the YARA rule and got the log event and a popup showing the malware being ran
- Tested out the base64 encoded command and it got passed the YARA rule
- Ran Floss to scan the file and received the flag
