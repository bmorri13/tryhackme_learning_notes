## Atomic Red Tool Testing & MITRE ATT&K Framework

- Goes over using Atomic red team tool for testing out simulated attacks
    - I have used this int he past for k8s and aws red team testing items!
- Went over seeing which MITRE framework these example attacks would map back to

### Room Example
- Testing out a Spearphishing and a command shell attack
- Viewed the events from Sysmon in the Event Viewer
- Reviewed which MITRE technique this maps back to
