# Advent of Cyber 2024

## Kubernetes DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response)

- Went over K8s
- Went over what DFIR is
- Went through basic container commands, went over ephemeral logs and where they can be stored locally

### Room Example

- Reviewed logs, ran through kubectl commands, etc. got flags and answers from log events and by running the kubectl get secret command to get the last secert value for the flag
